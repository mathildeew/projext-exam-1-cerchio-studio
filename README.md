The final project of the first year was a self-selected blog site, assigned to a fictional ceramic studio called Cerchio. The project is a summary of all skills learned the first year with an emphasis on design principles, web development and content management system. The blog features a search function, category filtering, a blogpost carousel and all the content stored as a headless CMS.
Hotjar was installed to give insight of user behaviour.
